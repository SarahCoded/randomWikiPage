# Get a Random Wikipedia Page

This Python script reads from a list of .en (English Language) Wikipedia titles that were visited at least once on the 21st July 2021, and returns a random title. The user is presented with a summary of the article, and can either open the selected page on their browser, keep on asking for new titles, or exit the program.
